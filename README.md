# Cheatsheet

Here are some commands and hotkeys that i use on a daily basis for the following tools / apps:
* Tmux - session management in a single terminal window like a boss
* Vim - most infamous and hackable terminal text based editor

## Glossary

Following some explanations if you are not familiar with the hotkey notation

* __C - b__ - hold the CTRL and b key at the same time
* __C - b %__ - hold CTRL and b key at the same time, then press % (SHIFT and 5)

## Tmux

__Note__: Hotkeys on MacOs might differ!

| hotkey/command | description |
| ---- | ---- |
| C - b c | new window |
| C - b n | switch to new next window |
| C - b p | switch to previous window |
| C - b <number> | switch to window by number |
| C - b â€œ | horizontal split pane |
| C - b % | vertical split pane |
| C - b z | fullscreen on current pane |
| C - b C <arrow key> | resize pane into arrow key direction |
| C - b d | deattach from session |
| C - b D |choose which session to detach |
| C - b <arrow key> | navigate split panes |
| tmux ls | list all sessions |
| tmux attach -t <number> | attach to session by number |

## Vim

__Note__: all commands starting with `:` as well as the hotkeys
needs to run in cmd mode (type ESC) and not insert mode!

It is in generally a good practice to always switch to cmd mode after you 
finished editing/inserting a word. Make it a natural behaviour to press ESC at 
the end and you will never have to ask yourself if you are currently in insert or
cmd mode.

My vimrc is based on a fork of [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc), as 
theme i use currently [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).
